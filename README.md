##Jupyter Documentation
"The Jupyter Notebook is a web application for interactive data science and scientific computing. Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video, and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer." http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
